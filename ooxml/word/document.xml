            <w:t> 13:10 ...  he stayed there for two years. Then he went to the southern territory as far as Bahalot. There was a famine in the land.  13:11 So Abram went to Egypt in the third year of the week. He lived in the land of Egypt for five years before his wife was taken from him by force.  13:12 Tanais, the Egyptian city, was built at that time — seven years after Hebron.  13:13 When the pharaoh took Abram's wife Sarah by force, the Lord punished the pharaoh and his household very severely because of Abram's wife Sarah.  13:14 At that time he made Abram extremely wealthy with all (kinds of) sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, horses, male and female servants, silver and very (much) gold. Lot — his brother's son — was also wealthy.  13:15 The pharaoh returned Abram's wife Sarah to her husband and expelled him from the land of Egypt. He went to the place where he had first pitched his tent — at the location of the altar, with Ai on the east side and Bethel on the west. He blessed the Lord his God who had brought him back safely. 13:16 During the forty-first jubilee, in the third year of the first week, he returned to this place. He offered sacrifices and called on the Lord's name: 'You, most high God, are my God forever and ever'.</w:t>

            <w:t> 13:17 In the fourth year of this week Lot separated from him. He settled in Sodom. Now the Sodomite people were very sinful.  13:18 They were evil in their hearts that Lot, his brother's son, had separated from him for he had no children.  13:19 Lot was taken captive from him. But in the fourth year of this week — of the same jubilee — God said to Abram: 'Look up from where you are staying toward the west, the south, the east, and the north;  13:20 because all the land which you see I will give to you and your descendants forever. I will make your descendants like the sands of the sea, for your descendants will not be counted.  13:21 Now you — get up and walk its width. Look at everything because I will give it to your descendants'. Then Abram went to Hebron and lived ...</w:t>
